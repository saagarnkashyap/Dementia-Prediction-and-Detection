# Dementia Prediction and Detection – Capstone Project Log

This repository documents my progress in building, testing, and comparing different AI models for **dementia prediction and detection**.  
The goal is to identify the most effective and efficient model that balances **accuracy, interpretability, and deployability** for real-world healthcare applications.

## Project Overview
Dementia affects millions worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve patient care.  
This project explores multiple deep learning approaches (CNNs, Transfer Learning, Vision Transformers, etc.) applied to MRI-based dementia datasets.

Key objectives:
- Compare traditional **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with advanced models such as **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**.
- Track performance metrics across experiments.
- Build a deployable framework for prediction (future integration into [NeuroASHA](https://github.com/saagarnkashyap/NeuroAsha)).
